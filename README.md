# Brief Introduction
This project includes test code for our research work which mainly focused on spatial crowdsourcing with consideration to 
location access permission and offline service permission.

We devised an algorithm in order to divide tasks published by requesters into smaller micro-tasks, which can help improve
task completion rate.

# Current Progress
Basically finished the core algorithm. However, the project has not been deployed to a server and we have not conducted any 
test using simulation data on this project so far.

此项目为算法的较原始版本，也未经充分测试，为当时存档记录用，可能无法完整展示最终版论文中所使用算法。
