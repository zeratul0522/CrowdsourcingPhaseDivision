# CrowdsourcingPhaseDivision
This project includes test code for our CSCW2018 paper which mainly focused on spatial crowdsourcing with consideration to 
location access permission and offline service permission.

We devised an algorithm which can help divide tasks published by requesters into smaller micro-tasks, which can help improve
task completion rate.

2018/04/11 first commit:
Basically finished the core algorithm. However, the project has not been deployed to a server and we have not conducted any 
test using simulation data on this project so far.
